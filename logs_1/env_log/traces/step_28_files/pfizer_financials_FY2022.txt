EXECUTIVE COMMENTARY
Dr. Albert Bourla, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated: “2022 was a record-breaking year for Pfizer, not only in terms of revenue and earnings per share, which were the highest in our long history, but more importantly, in terms of the percentage of patients who have a positive perception of Pfizer and the work we do. As proud as we are about what we have accomplished, our focus is always on what is next. As we turn to 2023, we expect to once again set records, with potentially the largest number of new product and indication launches that we’ve ever
-1-
had in such a short period of time. We believe that the combination of these expected near-term launches, additional pipeline products that could potentially come to market in the medium-term, and anticipated contributions from business development, has the potential to set the company up for continued robust growth through the rest of this decade and beyond.”
David Denton, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, stated: “I am very pleased with our fourth- quarter performance, which was highlighted by strong operational growth from Paxlovid, Prevnar 20, Comirnaty, Vyndaqel and Eliquis, as well as the inclusion of Nurtec ODT/Vydura and Oxbryta. For the full-year, we achieved revenues of over $100 billion, including 10 medicines or vaccines that generated revenues of more than $1 billion each, and all of this was accomplished despite operating in an environment in which foreign exchange reduced our revenues by 7%. Looking forward to 2023, we expect strong topline growth of 7% to 9% excluding our COVID-19 products and anticipated foreign exchange impacts. We are also increasing our investments behind our launch products and pipeline in order to help realize our growth goals for 2023 and beyond.”

             Beginning in the first quarter of 2022, Pfizer implemented changes to its Adjusted(3) financial measures with respect to acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D) costs and amortization of intangibles. More
-2-

information about these changes and their impact on the periods presented can be found in the Non-GAAP Financial Measure: Adjusted Income section of this press release.
Beginning in the third quarter of 2022, Pfizer has made several organizational changes to further transform its operations to better leverage its expertise in certain areas and in anticipation of potential future new product or indication launches. These changes include establishing a new commercial structure within Biopharma focused on three broad customer groups (primary care, specialty care and oncology)(6), optimizing our end-to-end R&D operations and further prioritizing our internal R&D portfolio, as well as realigning certain enabling and platform functions across the organization to ensure alignment with this new operating structure.
Prior period amounts have been revised to conform to the current period presentation for all changes discussed above.
Business development activities(7) completed in 2021 and 2022(5) impacted financial results in the periods presented. Some amounts in this press release may not add due to rounding. All percentages have been calculated using unrounded amounts. References to operational variances pertain to period-over-period changes that exclude the impact of foreign exchange rates(8).
2023 FINANCIAL GUIDANCE(4)
Pfizer’s 2023 financial guidance is presented below. This guidance includes management’s expectations for contributions from the entire company, including Comirnaty(1) and Paxlovid.

2022 Actual Results $100.3 billion
30% 23%
$6.58
71% 62%
2023 Financial Guidance $67.0 to $71.0 billion
(33%) to (29%) (33%) to (29%)
$3.25 to $3.45
(50%) to (47%) (51%) to (48%)
     The midpoint of the guidance range for revenues reflects a 31% operational decrease compared to 2022 revenues. Company revenues are anticipated to be lower in 2023 than in 2022 due entirely to expected revenue declines for Pfizer’s COVID-19 products.
Excluding COVID-19 products, the Company continues to expect 7% to 9% operational revenue growth in 2023. Revenue guidance for Pfizer’s COVID-19 products is as follows:
▪ Comirnaty(1) revenues of approximately $13.5 billion, down 64% from actual 2022 results.
-3-

▪ Paxlovid revenues of approximately $8 billion, down 58% from actual 2022 results.
▪ In contrast to previous years, guidance for both products is no longer based primarily on expected deliveries under existing signed or committed supply contracts, but now also includes, among other things, anticipated sales through traditional commercial markets in the U.S. in the second half of 2023.
The midpoint of the guidance range for Adjusted(3) diluted EPS reflects a 49% operational decrease compared to 2022, primarily driven by anticipated lower revenues from COVID-19 products, higher spending to support anticipated near-term launches and greater investments in certain late-stage pipeline projects.
Financial guidance for Adjusted diluted EPS(3) is calculated using approximately 5.75 billion weighted average shares outstanding, and assumes no share repurchases in 2023.
Other components of Pfizer’s 2023 financial guidance are presented below.

$12.4 to $13.4 billion Approximately $0.1 billion Approximately $1.5 billion of income Approximately 15.0%
      Pfizer’s 2023 financial guidance is based on estimates and assumptions which are subject to significant uncertainties, particularly with regard to the anticipated performance of Comirnaty(1) and Paxlovid, for which patient demand could be significantly impacted by the infectiousness and severity of the predominant strains of the SARS-CoV-2 virus during 2023.
