        }
        Observation: [A success message if the file is copied successfully, or an error message if the file cannot be copied.]
        ```

- Undo Edit Script:
        Use this to undo the last edit of the python script.
        Usage:
        ```
        Action: Undo Edit Script
        Action Input: {
            "script_name": [a valid python script name with relative path to current directory if needed]
        }
        Observation: [The observation will be the content of the script before the last edit. If the script does not exist, the observation will be an error message.]
        ```

- Execute Script:
        Use this to execute the python script. The script must already exist.
        Usage:
        ```
        Action: Execute Script
        Action Input: {
            "script_name": [a valid python script name with relative path to current directory if needed]

        }
        Observation: [The observation will be empty.]
        ```

- Understand File:
        Use this to read the whole file and understand certain aspects. You should provide detailed description on what to look for and what should be returned. To get a better understanding of the file, you can use Inspect Script Lines action to inspect specific part of the file.
        Usage:
        ```
        Action: Understand File
        Action Input: {
            "file_name": [a valid file name with relative path to current directory if needed],
            "things_to_look_for": [a detailed description on what to look for and what should returned]
        }
        Observation: [The observation will be a description of relevant content and lines in the file. If the file does not exist, the observation will be an error message.]
        ```

- Inspect Script Lines:
        Use this to inspect specific part of a python script precisely, or the full content of a short script. The number of lines to display is limited to 100 lines. This is especially helpful when debugging.
        Usage:
        ```
        Action: Inspect Script Lines
        Action Input: {
            "script_name": [a valid python script name with relative path to current directory if needed],

        ```

- Edit Script (AI):
        Use this to do a relatively large but cohesive edit over a python script. Instead of editing the script directly, you should describe the edit instruction so that another AI can help you do this.
        Usage:
        ```
        Action: Edit Script (AI)
        Action Input: {
            "script_name": [a valid python script name with relative path to current directory if needed. An empty sctipt will be created if it does not exist.],
            "edit_instruction": [a detailed step by step description on how to edit it.],
            "save_name": [a valid file name with relative path to current directory if needed]
        }
        Observation: [The observation will be the edited content of the script. If the script does not exist, the observation will be an error message. You should always double check whether the edit is correct. If it is far from correct, you can use the Undo Edit Script action to undo the edit.]
        ```

- Reflection:
        Use this to look over all the past steps and reflect. You should provide detailed description on what to reflect on and what should be returned.
        Usage:
        ```
        Action: Reflection
        Action Input: {
            "things_to_reflect_on": [a detailed description on what to reflect on and what should be returned]
        }
        Observation: [The observation will be a the reflection.]
        ```



Research Problem: You are a business development consultant for Pfizer, the manufacturer of a COVID-19 vaccine. The company is interested in knowing what regions and demographics it should expand its vaccine marketing and delivery. Vaccine hesitancy is also a relevant problem facing our industry. Your task is to derive actionable insights from the available data, which includes vaccine rate data contained in CSV files, research articles, and miscellaneous documents related to Pfizer, including financials and a CEO transcript. You also can search the internet. Ensure that all of your insights can be supported by data. When you are ready, write a report that contains your actionable insights and supporting evidence. 

Ensure that all of your insights can be supported by data. When you are ready, write a report that contains your actionable insights and supporting evidence. 
Never try to understand a csv file as it is. You can only access a csv file by loading in a python script and print statements which might provide you some insights.

Here is a good initial research plan:
First list all files in the directory to remember their names
Examine the Pfizer CEO interview transcript to find out about the companyâ€™s current direction.
Examine the vaccinations by state CSV file by loading into a python script provided (analyse_vaccinations.py).
Extract some useful statistics by modifying analyse_vaccinations.py
Determine if useful information exists in the research papers, which are named by their title.
Examine the Pfizer financial information.
Synthesize the information in your generated log file to create your final report.

Make sure to first go through all documents provided to you before declaring a final answer.
 
Concretely, remember your final goal of answering the following set of questions in addition to any good insights that you generated from data:
1. Give me 3 states with the lowest vaccination rates?
2. Mean and median vaccination rates across states?
3. Provide some connections from various data sources which you explored?

Always remember to NEVER try to understand a csv file directly. Always look at a csv file
by writing some python code in analyse_vaccinations.py and printing some stuff in it (such as useful statistics).



You do not know anything about this problem so far. 

Follow these instructions and do not forget them:
- First, come up with a high level plan based on your understanding of the problem and available tools and record it in the Research Plan and Status. You can revise the plan later.
- Research Plan and Status should well organized and succinctly keep track of 1) high level plan (can be revised), 2) what steps have been done and what steps are in progress, 3) short results and conclusions of each step after it has been performed. 
- Research Plan and Status must only include progress that has been made by previous steps. It should not include results not directly confirmed by the previous observation. 
- Performance numbers and estimates can only be confirmed and included in the status by running the code and observing the output.
- You should come up with a good experiment design that addresses the problem, and whenever applicable, define and measure the baseline performance of the relevant system or model before attempting any improvements.
- Follow the plan and try to achieve the goal as straightforwardly as possible.
- Highlight the supporting experiment results and reasoning before drawing any conclusions. 
- Do not try installing any new packages or libraries.
- If you believe you have solved the problem, you can use the Final Answer action to submit your answer. You can only submit once, so double check that you have achieved the goal before submitting.

Always respond in this format exactly:
Reflection: What does the observation mean? If there is an error, what caused the error and how to debug?
Research Plan and Status: The full high level research plan, with current status and confirmed results of each step briefly annotated. It must only include progress that has been made by previous steps. If there is any update, enclose the new update text in double asterisks **like this**. If there is no update, just copy the previous step Research Plan and Status. The high level plan from the previous step should be fully retained, unless it is intentionally revised.
Fact Check: List all objective statements in the updates to Research Plan and Status one by one and point out whether it is guessed versus directly confirmed by the previous observation directly above. Performance numbers can only be confirmed by running the code and observing the output.
Thought: What you are currently doing, what actions to perform and why
Action: the action to take, should be one of the names of the tools
Action Input: the input to the action as a valid JSON string
Observation: 
```
the result of the action
```


        Here is a summary of relevant actions and observations you have done:
        ```
         Here is a concise summary of the relevant information from the research log:

Files available:
- Pfizer CEO transcript (pfizer_ceo_transcript_march_31_2022.txt)
- US state vaccination data (us_state_vaccinations.csv)
- Pfizer financials (pfizer_financials_FY2022.txt)
- Research papers (3 files)

Key insights from Pfizer CEO transcript:
- Top priority is developing variant-proof vaccine with 1-year protection 
- Expect data on 4th booster and under 5 vaccine next month, hope for approval in May
- Disagree with limiting child vaccination, believe all 5+ should be vaccinated 
- Developing oral treatment for children, hope available before school in fall
- Chose not to take government funding for more flexibility and speed 
- Focused on speed in development, coining "time is life"
- Waived IP rights for pill, but mRNA tech too complex for others to replicate
- Focused on improving and new mRNA vaccines, including flu
- Exploring mRNA for cancer treatment (2-3 years) and genetic diseases 

Statistics from US state vaccination data:
- Mean fully vaccinated rate: 68.95%
- Median fully vaccinated rate: 66.95%

Issues executing Understand File action for research papers.

Key next steps:
1. Examine Pfizer financials to determine revenue, costs, and profits related to COVID-19 vaccine
2. Further analyze US state vaccination data to identify states with lowest rates and possible reasons 
3. Summarize key insights and statistics in a report with recommendations for Pfizer
        ```
        Here are the exact several steps you have done most recently (up to 3 steps):
        

Assistant:
Reflection:    The observation shows the output from executing the edited analyse_vaccinations.py script. In addition to the initial output, it now prints the mean fully vaccination rate of 68.95% and median of 66.95% across US states. This provides useful summary statistics to characterize vaccination rates across states.

Research Plan and Status:      
1. Examine the Pfizer CEO interview transcript to find out about the companyâ€™s current direction. Done. Summary in previous observation.  
2. Examine the vaccinations by state CSV file by loading into a python script provided (analyse_vaccinations.py). Extract some useful statistics by modifying analyse_vaccinations.py. Python script executed and edited to extract mean and median vaccination rates. Mean: 68.95%, Median: 66.95%.  
3. Determine if useful information exists in the research papers, which are named by their title.   
4. Examine the Pfizer financial information.    
5. Synthesize the information in your generated log file to create your final report.







Fact Check:    
1. The script has been executed. **Confirmed**
2. Here is the output: **Confirmed**
3. Index(['location', 'people_fully_vaccinated_per_hundred', 'total_vaccinations_per_hundred', 'daily_vaccinations_per_million'],dtype='object') **Confirmed** 
4. [5 rows x 4 columns] **Confirmed**
5. 68.95672131147542 **Confirmed**
6. 66.95 **Confirmed**
