Research Problem: You are a business development consultant for Pfizer, the manufacturer of a COVID-19 vaccine. The company is interested in knowing what regions and demographics it should expand its vaccine marketing and delivery. Vaccine hesitancy is also a relevant problem facing our industry. Your task is to derive actionable insights from the available data, which includes vaccine rate data contained in CSV files, research articles, and miscellaneous documents related to Pfizer, including financials and a CEO transcript. You also can search the internet. Ensure that all of your insights can be supported by data. When you are ready, write a report that contains your actionable insights and supporting evidence. 

Ensure that all of your insights can be supported by data. When you are ready, write a report that contains your actionable insights and supporting evidence. 
Never try to understand a csv file as it is. You can only access a csv file by loading in a python script and print statements which might provide you some insights.

Here is a good initial research plan:
First list all files in the directory to remember their names
Examine the Pfizer CEO interview transcript to find out about the company’s current direction.
Examine the vaccinations by state CSV file by loading into a python script provided (analyse_vaccinations.py).
Extract some useful statistics by modifying analyse_vaccinations.py
Determine if useful information exists in the research papers, which are named by their title.
Examine the Pfizer financial information.
Synthesize the information in your generated log file to create your final report.

Make sure to first go through all documents provided to you before declaring a final answer.
 
Concretely, remember your final goal of answering the following set of questions in addition to any good insights that you generated from data:
1. Give me 3 states with the lowest vaccination rates?
2. Mean and median vaccination rates across states?
3. Provide some connections from various data sources which you explored?

Always remember to NEVER try to understand a csv file directly. Always look at a csv file
by writing some python code in analyse_vaccinations.py and printing some stuff in it (such as useful statistics).



You do not know anything about this problem so far. 

Follow these instructions and do not forget them:
- First, come up with a high level plan based on your understanding of the problem and available tools and record it in the Research Plan and Status. You can revise the plan later.
- Research Plan and Status should well organized and succinctly keep track of 1) high level plan (can be revised), 2) what steps have been done and what steps are in progress, 3) short results and conclusions of each step after it has been performed. 
- Research Plan and Status must only include progress that has been made by previous steps. It should not include results not directly confirmed by the previous observation. 
- Performance numbers and estimates can only be confirmed and included in the status by running the code and observing the output.
- You should come up with a good experiment design that addresses the problem, and whenever applicable, define and measure the baseline performance of the relevant system or model before attempting any improvements.
- Follow the plan and try to achieve the goal as straightforwardly as possible.
- Highlight the supporting experiment results and reasoning before drawing any conclusions. 
- Do not try installing any new packages or libraries.
- If you believe you have solved the problem, you can use the Final Answer action to submit your answer. You can only submit once, so double check that you have achieved the goal before submitting.

Always respond in this format exactly:
Reflection: What does the observation mean? If there is an error, what caused the error and how to debug?
Research Plan and Status: The full high level research plan, with current status and confirmed results of each step briefly annotated. It must only include progress that has been made by previous steps. If there is any update, enclose the new update text in double asterisks **like this**. If there is no update, just copy the previous step Research Plan and Status. The high level plan from the previous step should be fully retained, unless it is intentionally revised.
Fact Check: List all objective statements in the updates to Research Plan and Status one by one and point out whether it is guessed versus directly confirmed by the previous observation directly above. Performance numbers can only be confirmed by running the code and observing the output.
Thought: What you are currently doing, what actions to perform and why
Action: the action to take, should be one of the names of the tools
Action Input: the input to the action as a valid JSON string
Observation:

        Here is a summary of relevant actions and observations you have done:
        ```
         Here is a concise summary of the relevant information from the research log:

Files examined:
- pfizer_ceo_transcript_march_31_2022.txt
- us_state_vaccinations.csv (using analyse_vaccinations.py script)
- pfizer_financials_FY2022.txt

Key insights:
- Pfizer's top priorities are developing a variant-proof COVID-19 vaccine with longer protection, vaccines for children, and an oral treatment. They aim to improve access and equity. 
- The mean vaccination rate across states is 68.95% and the median is 66.95%. 
- Pfizer's 2022 revenue was $100.3B, up 30% from 2021. Excluding COVID-19 products, revenue grew 2%. 
- Pfizer's 2023 revenue guidance is $67-71B. Excluding COVID-19 products, expected to grow 7-9%. 
- Comirnaty 2023 revenue guidance: ~$13.5B, down 64% from 2022. Paxlovid 2023 revenue guidance: ~$8B, down 58% from 2022.
- Pfizer's 2023 adjusted EPS guidance is $3.25 to $3.45, down 50-47% from 2022.

Connections across data sources:
- The CEO transcript indicates Pfizer's priorities are improving their COVID-19 vaccine and treatments, especially for children and against variants. The financials show declining revenue from Comirnaty and Paxlovid over the next year, suggesting the priorities around improving the vaccine and treatments are important for sustaining revenue. 
- The vaccination rates and financials both provide data at a state level in the U.S., so we could analyze the relationship between vaccination rates and Pfizer's revenue by state. This could identify opportunities for targeted marketing and outreach.

Key questions remaining: 
- What are Pfizer's manufacturing locations and capacity for the COVID-19 vaccine? 
- What is Pfizer's pricing strategy for the COVID-19 vaccine? 
- How will Pfizer improve access and equity for the COVID-19 vaccine, especially in lower-income countries?
- What are the trends in vaccine hesitancy for the COVID-19 vaccine in the U.S. and globally? How can Pfizer address this?

Examine the Pfizer CEO interview transcript to find out about the company’s current direction.
Examine the vaccinations by state CSV file by loading into a python script provided (analyse_vaccinations.py).
Extract some useful statistics by modifying analyse_vaccinations.py
Determine if useful information exists in the research papers, which are named by their title.
Examine the Pfizer financial information.
Synthesize the information in your generated log file to create your final report.

Make sure to first go through all documents provided to you before declaring a final answer.
 
Concretely, remember your final goal of answering the following set of questions in addition to any good insights that you generated from data:
1. Give me 3 states with the lowest vaccination rates?
2. Mean and median vaccination rates across states?
3. Provide some connections from various data sources which you explored?

Always remember to NEVER try to understand a csv file directly. Always look at a csv file
by writing some python code in analyse_vaccinations.py and printing some stuff in it (such as useful statistics).



You do not know anything about this problem so far. 

Follow these instructions and do not forget them:
- First, come up with a high level plan based on your understanding of the problem and available tools and record it in the Research Plan and Status. You can revise the plan later.
- Research Plan and Status should well organized and succinctly keep track of 1) high level plan (can be revised), 2) what steps have been done and what steps are in progress, 3) short results and conclusions of each step after it has been performed. 
- Research Plan and Status must only include progress that has been made by previous steps. It should not include results not directly confirmed by the previous observation. 
- Performance numbers and estimates can only be confirmed and included in the status by running the code and observing the output.
- You should come up with a good experiment design that addresses the problem, and whenever applicable, define and measure the baseline performance of the relevant system or model before attempting any improvements.
- Follow the plan and try to achieve the goal as straightforwardly as possible.
- Highlight the supporting experiment results and reasoning before drawing any conclusions. 
- Do not try installing any new packages or libraries.
- If you believe you have solved the problem, you can use the Final Answer action to submit your answer. You can only submit once, so double check that you have achieved the goal before submitting.

Always respond in this format exactly:
Reflection: What does the observation mean? If there is an error, what caused the error and how to debug?
Research Plan and Status: The full high level research plan, with current status and confirmed results of each step briefly annotated. It must only include progress that has been made by previous steps. If there is any update, enclose the new update text in double asterisks **like this**. If there is no update, just copy the previous step Research Plan and Status. The high level plan from the previous step should be fully retained, unless it is intentionally revised.
Fact Check: List all objective statements in the updates to Research Plan and Status one by one and point out whether it is guessed versus directly confirmed by the previous observation directly above. Performance numbers can only be confirmed by running the code and observing the output.
Thought: What you are currently doing, what actions to perform and why

         Here is a concise summary of the relevant information from the research log:

Files examined:
- pfizer_ceo_transcript_march_31_2022.txt
- us_state_vaccinations.csv (using analyse_vaccinations.py script)
- pfizer_financials_FY2022.txt

Key insights:
- Pfizer's top priorities are developing a variant-proof COVID-19 vaccine with longer protection, vaccines for children, and an oral treatment. They aim to improve access and equity. 
- The mean vaccination rate across states is 68.95% and the median is 66.95%. 
- Pfizer's 2022 revenue was $100.3B, up 30% from 2021. Excluding COVID-19 products, revenue grew 2%. 
- Pfizer's 2023 revenue guidance is $67-71B. Excluding COVID-19 products, expected to grow 7-9%. 
- Comirnaty 2023 revenue guidance: ~$13.5B, down 64% from 2022. Paxlovid 2023 revenue guidance: ~$8B, down 58% from 2022.
- Pfizer's 2023 adjusted EPS guidance is $3.25 to $3.45, down 50-47% from 2022.

Connections across data sources:
- The CEO transcript indicates Pfizer's priorities are improving their COVID-19 vaccine and treatments, especially for children and against variants. The financials show declining revenue from Comirnaty and Paxlovid over the next year, suggesting the priorities around improving the vaccine and treatments are important for sustaining revenue. 
- The vaccination rates and financials both provide data at a state level in the U.S., so we could analyze the relationship between vaccination rates and Pfizer's revenue by state. This could identify opportunities for targeted marketing and outreach.

Key questions remaining: 
- What are Pfizer's manufacturing locations and capacity for the COVID-19 vaccine? 
- What is Pfizer's pricing strategy for the COVID-19 vaccine? 
- How will Pfizer improve access and equity for the COVID-19 vaccine, especially in lower-income countries?
- What are the trends in vaccine hesitancy for the COVID-19 vaccine in the U.S. and globally? How can Pfizer address this?

}



Observation:
```
 Here is a summary of the key financial metrics and relevant excerpts from the given file:

Revenues: 
- Total 2022 revenue: $100.3 billion, up 30% operationally from 2021. Excluding COVID-19 products (Comirnaty and Paxlovid), revenue grew 2% operationally. (p.1)
- 2023 revenue guidance: $67.0 to $71.0 billion. Excluding COVID-19 products, expected to grow 7-9% operationally. (p.3)
- Comirnaty 2023 revenue guidance: ~$13.5 billion, down 64% from 2022. (p.3) 
- Paxlovid 2023 revenue guidance: ~$8 billion, down 58% from 2022. (p.3)

Costs:
- 2023 Adjusted Cost of Sales guidance as % of revenue: 28-30% (p.4) 
- 2023 Adjusted SI&A expense guidance: $13.8 to $14.8 billion (p.4)
- 2023 Adjusted R&D expense guidance: $12.4 to $13.4 billion (p.4)

Profits:
- 2022 Reported Net Income: $31.4 billion, up 43% from 2021. (p.2)
