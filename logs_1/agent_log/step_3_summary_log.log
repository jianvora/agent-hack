Human: Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:   The observation shows the output of running analyse_vaccinations.py. It prints the column names and first 5 rows of the data frame loaded from us_state_vaccinations.csv. This confirms the CSV file has been loaded successfully.

Research Plan and Status:    
1. Examine the Pfizer CEO interview transcript to find out about the companyâ€™s current direction. Done. Summary in previous observation.  
2. Examine the vaccinations by state CSV file by loading into a python script provided (analyse_vaccinations.py). Extract some useful statistics by modifying analyse_vaccinations.py. Python script executed, data loaded successfully. 
3. Determine if useful information exists in the research papers, which are named by their title.   
4. Examine the Pfizer financial information.    
5. Synthesize the information in your generated log file to create your final report.





Fact Check:    No new updates.

Thought:  I will modify analyse_vaccinations.py to extract mean and median vaccination rates across states.
