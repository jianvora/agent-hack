Human: Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:    There was an error executing the Understand File action on the "Vaccine hesitancy trends.pdf" file as well. Without being able to view the files, no information on trends in vaccine hesitancy or conclusions regarding the COVID-19 vaccine was obtained from the research papers.

Research Plan and Status:         
1. Examine the Pfizer CEO interview transcript to find out about the companyâ€™s current direction. Done. Summary in previous observation.  
2. Examine the vaccinations by state CSV file by loading into a python script provided (analyse_vaccinations.py). Extract some useful statistics by modifying analyse_vaccinations.py. Python script executed and edited to extract mean and median vaccination rates. Mean: 68.95%, Median: 66.95%.  
3. Determine if useful information exists in the research papers, which are named by their title. Attempted to examine "mRNA vaccine efficacy.pdf" and "Vaccine hesitancy trends.pdf" but received errors. No information obtained.  
4. Examine the Pfizer financial information.    
5. Synthesize the information in your generated log file to create your final report.











Fact Check: 
1. Error executing Understand File. **Confirmed** 
2. No information on trends in vaccine hesitancy or conclusions regarding the COVID-19 vaccine was obtained from the research papers. **Confirmed**

Thought:  Since I was unable to obtain information from the research papers, I will next examine Pfizer's financial information to determine the company's financial standing and ability to continue developing and distributing COVID-19 vaccines and treatments.
